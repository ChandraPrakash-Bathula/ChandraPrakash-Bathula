### CIFAR-10 CNN Details
- **Architecture**: 9 convolutional layers with batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and 3 fully connected layers
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (60,000 32x32 RGB images, 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
- **Training**: 100 epochs, SGD (momentum=0.9, weight decay=1e-6), CrossEntropyLoss, LR scheduling (initial 0.01, reduced on plateau)
- **Data Augmentation**: Color jitter, random perspective, random horizontal flip, normalization
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from huggingface_hub import from_pretrained_pytorch
  model = from_pretrained_pytorch("chandu1617/CIFAR10-CNN_Model")
