### PDF Request
You asked for a **PDF version** of this 54-day plan with tables and checkboxes for tracking. I can generate a formatted PDF with:
- Daily tasks in tables (Theory, Coding, Project/Networking, Interview Prep).
- Checkboxes for task completion.
- Sections for projects, resources, and tips.
- Visual schedule (Gantt chart style).

**Action**: Since I can’t directly generate or send files, I’ll create a markdown version of the PDF content that you can convert to PDF using tools like Pandoc, LaTeX, or an online converter (e.g., Dillinger.io). Alternatively, I can provide a detailed text-based table for each day that you can copy into a doc and print as a PDF. Let me know which you prefer:
1. **Markdown for PDF conversion** (full plan, tables, checkboxes).
2. **Text-based tables** (copy-paste into a doc).
3. **Other format** (specify).

For now, here’s a sample **text-based table** for Day 1 to show the format:

```
